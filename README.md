Evaluation of activity embeddings as input for neural networks (inspired by the NLP domain, see for example the famous Word2Vec package: https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/). This code was implemented for my master thesis (I may append the final PDF to the repository as theoretical foundation and discussion of results).
